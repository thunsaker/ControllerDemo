# ControllerDemo
## ASP.NET MVC Controllers Talk
### by Thomas Hunsaker

I gave a demo/presentation at work regarding ASP.NET MVC Controllers. This is the demo code used in the presentation, it may be downloaded, forked, modified, whatever you'd like. It was written in a few minutes with a demo in minde, so there may be errors and it might not be an example of "best practices", take it for what it is.

The presentation can be found on Google Drive: [Controllers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FsLZJQxCZi-BeqRw_BlxW9LJU_dlqgGF5iQ8qotkXYM/edit)
